# Range Finder
WoW Classic (SoD) AddOn

## Gotchas
This AddOn uses the Wing Clip spell to determine melee range so you will need to have learned this spell for the AddOn to work.

You need to configure the action slot for Wing Clip and Auto Shot by using the slash commands `/range-finder--wingclip [n]` (to set the slot position of Wing Clip), and `/range-finder--autoshot [n]` (to set the slot position of Auto Shot). [You can use this image to determine the slot number for each spell](https://i.imgur.com/VGArn.jpg). 

NOTE: This addon WILL NOT WORK if this is not done.
